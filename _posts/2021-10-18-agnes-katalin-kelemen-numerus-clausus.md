#### Abstract

Traditionally, by “numerus clausus refugees” historiography means Jewish Hungarian students who studied abroad in the interwar period because of antisemitic discrimination back home. Yet, students expelled because of communist activism, belong to this category too. The here proposed paper will present the activity and historical legacy of communist emigrant students from Hungary in the First Czechoslovak Republic.
