Our colleague Doina Anca Cretu was interviewed for the [July edition](https://aseees.org/newsnet-article/thinking-internationally-in-eastern-european-history-a-conversation-with-doina-anca-cretu/) of NewsNet, published bi-monthly by the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES). Talking about her work on refugees, refugee camps, and foreign humanitarian aid, she also introduced her new book. In [_Foreign Aid and State Building in Interwar Romania: In Quest of an Ideal_](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=36471&bottom_ref=subject) (Stanford University Press, 2024), she looks at the ways various Romanian state builders established their own rapport with foreign aid organizations in a period of transformation in the interwar period.
