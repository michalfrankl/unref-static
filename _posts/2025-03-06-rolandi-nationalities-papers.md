We are pleased to share the information that our colleague Francesca Rolandi has just published her article [Yugoslavia is (not) a Refugee Country? Refugees between Transit and Integration in an Ever-Changing Socialist State](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/yugoslavia-is-not-a-refugee-country-refugees-between-transit-and-integration-in-an-everchanging-socialist-state/50B49CA580D58E46A3AA0D1EFDCAF10B) in the _Nationalities Papers_. The text is available as open-access!

Throughout the Cold War, Yugoslavia was the only socialist country that participated in the Western-led international refugee regime and acted as a transit zone for refugees hoping to reach the Western Bloc. Those transiting were mainly, but not exclusively, escapees from various countries in the Soviet bloc. A few refugee groups also settled in Yugoslavia against the backdrop of shifts in international constellations, tense relationships with neighboring countries, and transnational mobilizations. This article will first investigate the dichotomy between transit and the few instances of refugees integrating into socialist Yugoslavia. Next, it will investigate the ease of the resettlement process by exploring how the length of time spent in the country was influenced by hierarchies among different refugee groups based on ethnic origin, political allegiances, class, and which opportunities for resettlement were available to whom. Finally, it will reflect on how the changing role of temporary refuge or permanent haven that Yugoslavia ascribed to itself was constructed and challenged by the host society, potential countries of resettlement, and the refugees themselves.
