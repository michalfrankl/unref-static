On 20 March 2024 at 9:30 CET, Nikola Tohma will give an online public talk about the Czechoslovak aid to child refugees from Greece as part of the 4EU+ Spring Seminar _[The Twentieth Century in European Memory: Themes and Approaches in Contemporary European Memory Studies](https://www.unlikely-refuge.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Syllabus.pdf)_. The series is organized by the Research Center for Memory Studies (Institute of International Studies, Faculty of Social Scieces, Charles University), COST Action Slow Memory and the Center for Research on Social Memory (Faculty of Sociology University of Warsaw).

The session will focus on Czechoslovak humanitarian aid for child refugees from the Greek Civil War (1946-1949). Shortly after the communist takeover of power in 1948, Czechoslovakia joined the relief initiative along with other Eastern Bloc countries and welcomed several thousand children of Greek partisans for a time-limited stay. Most of them eventually remained until adulthood, having received an education and fully established themselves abroad. The talk will revolve around the practices and actors of humanitarian aid and the memories of refugee children related to their arrival and deployment in children’s homes across the country.
