Lidia Zessin-Jurek (ERC Project _Unlikely Refuge?_) was invited to a special session of the _Badacze i Badaczki na Granicy_ (Researchers on the Border) group organised by Kamila Fiałkowska and Natalia Judzińska as part of the 11th Conference of the Migration Research Committee of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN), held in Łódź on 21-23 September 2022.

The one-day session focused on the question: "Why is there so little talk about the Polish-Belarusian border?". In her opening speech of the day, Lidia presented on the topic: "The return of no man's land in Polish geography—1939 and 2021—on the validity of comparing refugee situations".
