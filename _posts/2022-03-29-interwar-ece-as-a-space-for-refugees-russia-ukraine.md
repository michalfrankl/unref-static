### **Research position for a scholar at risk**

ERC project _Unlikely refuge?_

Masaryk Institute and Archives of the Czech Academy of Sciences

Initial deadline May 15, 2022

Full-time position for 24 months

The ERC-Consolidator project _Unlikely refuge? Refugees and citizens in East-Central Europe_ opens a new position for a scholar at risk with a focus on the history of refugees from Russia and Ukraine into East-Central Europe.

The project aims to write refugees back into the history of East-Central Europe, a region that is often considered a place to leave rather than to search refuge in. Since September 2019, the project team has been systematically probing the interactions of civil societies, humanitarian organizations, and nation-states with refugees in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and their successor states in the 20th century. More information is available at the project website: [https://www.unlikely-refuge.eu/](https://www.unlikely-refuge.eu/)

The position will provide new perspectives on the history of refugees from Russia and Ukraine living in the countries under the purview of the project, with a focus on the interwar period. In contrast to conventional approaches which often examine national, cultural, and political identities in exile, this research will focus on the social history of refugeedom, inclusion and exclusion from citizenship, and the critical history of humanitarianism.

The envisioned working place is Prague, Czech Republic, making it also possible to use the resources in the Slavic Library in Prague and beyond.

We expect the candidate to be able to conduct historical research in relevant languages, as well as to have a working knowledge of English in order to collaborate in the _Unlikely refuge?_ research team. Applications from historians as well as researchers in other disciplines relevant for the subject are encouraged.

Informal inquiries including information about your research interests and experience, as well as your current situation are encouraged. Inquiries can be directed to Dr. Michal Frankl, the principal investigator of the project at [frankl@mua.cas.cz](mailto:frankl@mua.cas.cz).

Review of applications will begin immediately after the initial deadline and continue until the position is filled. The start is possible at any moment (conditional on the fulfillment of legal conditions for employment in the Czech Republic).
