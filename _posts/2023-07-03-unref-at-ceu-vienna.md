The _Unlikely Refuge?_ team members participated at the "Remaking the World in the Shadow of the Cold War. Migrants, Workers, Soldiers, Spies in Post-1945 Reconstruction" workshop that took place at Central European University in Vienna on 1-2 June 2023. Apart from acting as chairs, two our researchers presented their own papers. Nikola Tohma gave a talk titled _Turning Political Asylees into Stakhanovites: Greek Civil War Refugees as Builders of Postwar Czechoslovak Socialism_. Julia Reinke presented her paper _"Socialist in Content, National in Form"? Dealing with Refugee Children from the Greek Civil War in the Early German Democratic Republic and Communist Poland_. The workshop was coorganized by CEU and the UnREF ERC project.
