The _Unlikely Refuge?_ team member Doina Anca Cretu published an essay titled "A Regime of Immobility" in the History Workshop journal.

Can refugee assistance become a way to contain? Doina Anca Cretu explores how those fleeing Austria-Hungary's peripheries in the First World War could also be immobilised, as they were subject to stereotypes of criminalisation.
