The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum organised the Silberman Seminar 'Refugees and the Holocaust' on 5-13 June 2024, an event in which Lidia Zessin-Jurek was invited to participate. Faculty members discussed the tangled history of the Holocaust and the colonial transit points that refugees navigated, and, among other things, considered the role of objects in telling and understanding refugee stories, the power of museum exhibitions in communicating knowledge about past and present victims of displacement, and different approaches to bringing this information into academic education.
