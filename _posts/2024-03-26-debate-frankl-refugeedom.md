We cordially invite you to a public debate titled "Refugeedom: History, Present and Global Context" organized by the _Dominikánská 8_ cultural and educational centre (Husova 8, 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic) on 13 May 2024 at 7:30 p.m.

Moderated by Daniela Vrbová, the discussion will be joined by Michal Frankl (_Unlikely Refuge?_ ERC project), Jakub Andrle (_People in Need_) and Martin Rozumek (_Organization for Aid to Refugees_). The guests will share their perspectives on the changing refugee situations over time in light of historical events and conflicts.

In which sense is the current situation of refugees particular? What are the specifics of Jewish and Ukrainian refugees with regard to legal and humanitarian issues? How do cultural and religious aspects affect the life of refugees and their integration into society? What role do international humanitarian organizations play in solving refugee crises? The debate (in Czech) will address these as well as many other questions.
