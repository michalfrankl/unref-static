The _Unlikely Refuge?_ project team has published an online and open-access searchable bibliographical database of existing literature relating to research on migration and refugeedom in East-Central Europe, namely Poland, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and their successor states, during the 20th century.

You can access the bibliographical database via Zotero by clicking [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4731282/unlikely_refuge_bibliography/library) or on the image below. For an easier use, you can search through the database using the suggested tags (down the left side of the frontpage) to limit the results geographically and thematically or to focus on specific refugee groups and historic events resulting in their refugeedom.

The bibliography is a work-in-progress and will be constantly updated. For a better context, we suggest confering the open-access [thematic issue](https://www.zfo-online.de/portal/index.php/zfo/issue/view/294) of the Journal of East European Studies (ZfO), Vol. 71 No. 4 (2022), that examines, through the eyes of historiography, East Central Europe as a place of refuge.
