The UnRef's PI Michal Frankl was interviewed by a Czech-language online magazine Reportér. In the article, published on 2 March 2022, he reminds of WWI refugees from the territory of today's Ukraine arriving in Austria-Hungary (including the Czech lands) during the First World War. Not only the Volhynian Czechs but generally people leaving their homes fled the war by traveling closer to the monarchy's center. Frankl describes how the Czech society treated refugees back then and explains why we tend to support ones while rejecting the others.
