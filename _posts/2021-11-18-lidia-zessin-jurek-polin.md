The refugee situation unfolding on the Polish-Belarusian border is reminiscent of similar events in the past. There were two moments in Polish history when thousands of migrants, pushed out by violence or fleeing danger, were stuck on the border, often under the barrels of soldiers and policemen. Our UnRef team member, Lidia Zessin-Jurek was invited by the Museum of the History of Polish Jews Polin to take part in the debate (November 22nd, 7:30 pm, transmitted online), together with other experts: Maciej Duszczyk and Robert Traba to talk about how these events occurred and how the Polish authorities and society reacted to them. The participants of the debate will also seek to answer the question of what conclusions can be drawn from this historical experience for us today. The meeting will be moderated by Prof. Dariusz Stola.
