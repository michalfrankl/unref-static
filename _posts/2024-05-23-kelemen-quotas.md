Ágnes Katalin Kelemen has published her chapter "Next Year in Brno? Brno’s Significance for Hungarian Jews in the Age of the Numerus Clausus and Beyond" as part of the edited volume [Quotas: The “Jewish Question” and Higher Education in Central Europe, 1880-1945](https://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/MillerQuotas) (ed. Michael L. Miller and Judith Szapor).

Book description:

In 1920, the Hungarian parliament introduced a Jewish quota for university admissions, making Hungary the first country in Europe to pass antisemitic legislation following World War I. _Quotas_ explores the ideologies and practices of quota regimes and the ways quotas have been justified, implemented, challenged, and remembered from the late nineteenth century until the middle of the twentieth century. In particular, the volume focuses on Central and Eastern Europe, with chapters covering the origins of quotas, the moral, legal, and political arguments developed by their supporters and opponents, and the social and personal impact of these attempts to limit access to higher education.
