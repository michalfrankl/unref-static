The recently published collective volume _**Reimagining Citizenship in Postwar Europe**_ (ed. R. Chin - S.C. Huneke; Cornell University Press 2025) features a book chapter on citizenship and statelessness of Greek Civil War refugees in Czechoslovakia, written by the UnRef team member Nikola Tohma.

_**Reimagining Citizenship in Postwar Europe**_ maps the generation and growth of novel forms of belonging in the years after World War II, crisscrossing the continent from Madrid to Warsaw and from Athens to London. Even as Europe struggled to rebuild, new forms of identity, statehood, and citizenship were beginning to take shape. In these decades, citizenship was reimagined in unusual settings and unexpected ways by ordinary citizens, living in democratic and authoritarian regimes alike, who struggled to forge new kinds of belonging through which to assert their human rights and dignity. Collecting the work of fifteen scholars, __Reimagining Citizenship in Postwar Europe__ contends that if we are to grapple with fraying citizenship in the twenty-first century, we must first look to when, how, and why citizenship originated in the calamitous years after World War II.

The entire book is available as [open-access](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501779190/reimagining-citizenship-in-postwar-europe/ and is also available Open Access.).
