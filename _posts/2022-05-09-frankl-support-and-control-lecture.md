The lecture will focus on two historical situations in which the Czech lands - like nowadays - have become a refuge for a large number of refugees, coming due to war violence and border shifts. The need to receive refugees fleeing the Habsburg monarchy during the First World War and the people expelled from the Czechoslovak borderlands after the Munich Agreement led to the mobilization of state funds and extensive assistance from society. At the same time, the state, as well as aid organizations, used these cases of humanitarian aid and learned how to sort, move and control people on the run. In particular, their ethnic differentiation significantly affected both immediate assistance and further fates of refugees.
