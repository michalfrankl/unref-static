Listen to the second episode of the "Eastern Europe's Minorities in a Century of Change", a podcast series on the history of minorities and minority experiences in twentieth-century Central and Eastern Europe prepared by the BASEES Stud soundcloud.com.

In this episode, Michal Frankl, principal investigator of the ERC-funded project “Unlikely refuge? Refugees and citizens in East-Central Europe in the 20th century” at the Masaryk Institute and Archive of the Czech Academy of Sciences talks to Matthew Frank, Associate Professor in International History at the University of Leeds about the mass displacement of minority populations in interwar Europe. Focussing primarily on the ideologies and actions of governments and international organizations, Matthew considers how such population transfers concurred with the nascent minority protection regime set out by the League of Nations and came to be widely accepted as a state-building mechanism for the newly established nation-states of Eastern Europe.

The episode titled _Minority Protection and Population Transfers in Interwar Europe_ is now available [online](https://soundcloud.com/user-267970745/episode-2-minority-protection-and-population-transfers-in-interwar-europe?si=69ce05ae2588483a87ccecde976bff1a).
