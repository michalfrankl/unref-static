Doina Anca Cretu published her new open-access article entitled _“War is destructive, but it reconstructs anew…:” Refugee Education and State Consolidation in Imperial Austria during the First World War_ in the [Nationalities Papers (2024)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/war-is-destructive-but-it-reconstructs-anew-refugee-education-and-state-consolidation-in-imperial-austria-during-the-first-world-war/FD674216B4B34CE50577D7ECC4DA79F5?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=socialnetwork).

The article explores aspects of the organization of refugee education in imperial Austria during the First World War. Authorities in charge of refugees’ control and their eventual assistance interpreted access to education in two ways. First, it was an avenue of relief through schooling, aimed to counter the effects of uprootedness and, thus, safeguard some continuity in refugee children’s lives. Second, it was a way to ensure the making of productive and loyal citizens. In this context, this article looks at various policies regarding organization of schooling for displaced children. Moreover, it analyzes the ways language entered the realm of the refugee-focused classroom. Officials used schooling in refugee students’ vernacular to relieve the effects of their displacement and to reinforce ethnonational classifications of imperial subjects. At the same time, education through refugee children’s growing exposure to German language courses became a measure of a gradual inculcation of an imperial consciousness. Furthermore, it was a civilizing dimension of displacement management and, in this way, it became an avenue to consolidate a war-feeble state.
