We tend to push them aside on a daily basis, but the faraway conflicts, consequences of climate change and hunger, have long been reaching Europe's borders, including, for some time, those of Eastern Europe. They take the form of refugees on our doorstep. What happens to these people once they have made it to the “safe” side? Whose responsibility are they? - asks our Poland-expert, Lidia Zessin-Jurek in an essay inspired by her field trip to the Polish-Belarusian border.
