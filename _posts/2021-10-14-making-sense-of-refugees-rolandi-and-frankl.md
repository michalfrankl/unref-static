On Wednesday, 14 October 2021 the Graduate School and the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (IOS) hosts a lecture by Francesca Rolandi and Michal Frankl (_Unlikely Refuge?_) entitled "Making Sense of Refugees: Historiography of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia".

The presenters will analyze and compare the approaches to refugees in the 20th century in the historiographies of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. How did historians of both countries describe and categorise those who searched for refuge? How are refugees integrated into the national master narratives and what meanings, national and other, historians attach to the refugeedom?
