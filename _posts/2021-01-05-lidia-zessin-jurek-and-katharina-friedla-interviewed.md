“Saved” in the East, or “Survivors” of the East? Even today there is still a disagreement on how we should perceive Jewish refugees from Poland, who were deported by Stalin to Siberia. Only now the memory of their experience and loss comes out of the great shadow cast by the Nazi extermination and the shadow of the Polish, Catholic experience in Siberia, the “Calvary of the East”.

The _Unlikely Refuge?_ team member Lidia Zessin-Jurek together with Katharina Friedla were interviewed by Adam Szostkiewicz for the Jewish Museum Galicia.
