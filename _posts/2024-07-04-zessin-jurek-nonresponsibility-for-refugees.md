In the new issue of the journal "Migration Studies - Review of Polish Diaspora" (Studia Migracyjne), devoted to the situation of refugees on the Polish-Belarusian border (edited by Natalia Judzińska and Mateusz Krępa), Lidia Zessin-Jurek contributed an essay on the challenges of communicating the protracted "crisis" in an era where information sources are distrusted and the so-called Western world is increasingly aware that the moral values it officially upholds will be increasingly difficult to live up to.

You can find her text "(Non)responsibility for Refugees – Communicating about the Belarusian-Polish Border (2021–2023)" [here](https://ejournals.eu/en/journal/smpp/article/non-responsibility-for-refugees-communicating-about-the-belarusian-polish-border-2021-2023).
