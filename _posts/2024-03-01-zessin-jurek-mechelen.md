Museum and Research Centre Kazerne Dossin (Mechelen/Belgium) invited Lidia Zessin-Jurek to talk on the political instrumentalisation of Holocaust memory in Europe at the ["Holocaust and Human Rights" Conference](https://kazernedossin.eu/en/event-item/conference-on-the-holocaust-and-human-rights/) (21-22 February 2024). Lidia drew a link between the reflection on this topical issue and how coming to terms with genocide does (or does not) affect the reception of refugees in Western and Eastern Europe.
