# Refugee protection in the plural

This website and research network explores the diversity of refugee protection. It supports research and discussion about refugee assistance in regions normally not seen as safe havens. It advances thinking beyond established Western templates, legal frameworks and institutions and bringing the forms of refugee care in Western liberal countries in conversation with those in the Global East and South.

## Unlikely Refuge? Project

The network originates from the ERC Consolidator project *Unlikely Refuge? Refugees and Citizens in East-Central Europe in the 20th Century* (2019-26) which explored the interactions of civil societies, humanitarian organisations and nation-states with refugees in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and their successor states in the 20th century. It brought attention to refugee protection, or its lack, in the context of state-building and nationalism, ethnic conflicts and wars, as well as authoritarian and totalitarian political regimes.
